# Hi there, I'm [Felix](https://github.com/Moccasym) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack developer with a background in microsystem technologies and electrical engineering. I have experience working as a hardware programmer and hardware designer, and I recently completed the [Zero to Mastery course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/) on full-stack development from Udemy.

## Skills

- HTML
- CSS
- React
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Git
- C
- Deployment

## AI Assistence
As an enthusiast of artificial intelligence (AI), I have found working with ChatGPT (OpenAI's language model) to be particularly advantageous in assisting me with coding projects. I firmly believe that the ability to effectively communicate with AI and formulating precise and targeted inquiries to elicit accurate responses, will become a crucial skill in the near future. Moreover, ChatGPT/AI has the potential to be a valuable tool in the process of debugging and error detection. I am eager to continue my exploration of AI and its application in my future projects.
